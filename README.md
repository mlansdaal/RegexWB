Regular Expression Workbench (v2 by Eric Gunnerson)

# About
Regular Expression Workbench is a small tool that allows you to experiment with and test [.NET regular expressions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az24scfc(v=vs.110).aspx). While some "cheat" sheets exist ( see [RegexLib.com](http://regexlib.com/CheatSheet.aspx) or [Regegg.com](http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html) ) and some great books (e.g., [Mastering Regular Expressions](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596528124?tag=onamazon-20) the expressions can quickly become complex and its not always apparent that they work (or why they don't work). This tool is a handy "open source" tool that can be used to explore and iteratively develop regular expressions.

# Reference
Eric Gunnerson had posted the [announcement](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericgu/2003/07/07/regular-expression-workbench-v2-0/) of the v2.0 code on his blog, which linked to [gotdotnet](http://www.gotdotnet.com/). Unfortunately that site is now defunct and the source code is now unreachable. However, I had taken a snapshot of the code back in 2006 and contacted Eric for his permission to publish it here on github (or to see if he had already done so).

#Details
Please see [short descriptive file](./Doc/RegexWorkbench.htm) for more details

#Alternatives
[Expresso](http://www.ultrapico.com/expresso.htm) and [Regulator](http://regex.osherove.com/) - see [Regulator Code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/regulator/) have been around for a long time, however Expresso is closed-source and back when I grabbed the Regular Expression Workbench code I think Regulator was not fully open sourced.
